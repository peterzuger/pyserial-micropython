# not inherited across a fork().
#
# These cmd values will set locks that conflict with process-associated
# record  locks, but are "owned" by the open file description, not the
# process. This means that they are inherited across fork() like BSD (flock)
# locks, and they are only released automatically when the last reference to
# the the open file against which they were acquired is put.
